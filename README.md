# Natural Language processsing Projects:
## What's NLP?
According to Wikipedia, Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, and, in particular, concerned with programming computers to fruitfully process large natural language corpora. Simply put, NLP's goal is to create systems capable processing natural language at or above human level.

# NLP technical application areas
NLP techniques can be applied to voice or text. Here are some of the primary application areas:

Sentiment Analysis:

Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) is an interesting type of data mining that measures the inclination of peopleâ€™s opinions. The task of this analysis is to identify subjective information in the text.

Chatbot: 

NLP has become the basis for creating chatbots, and although such systems are not so perfect they easily can handle standard tasks. Chatbots currently operate on several channels, including the Internet, applications, and messaging platforms.

Semantics:

Auto summarization: Summarize most important points in the text leaving out irrelevant or unnecessary information.

Spell Checking

A spell checker is a software tool that identifies and corrects any spelling mistakes in a text.

Speech:

Speech recognition or transcription: Given sound clip of one or more people speaking, transcribe the speech. This is the opposite of text to speech. Some of the challenges are: hard-to-discern pauses between successive words, sounds representing successive letters blending into each other(coarticulation). Though this is a challenging problem, especially in a noisy environment, Microsoft claims that its software reached human parity in transcription on a research paper published in 2017.

Text to speech: Convert text to speech. Google's DeepMind achieved near-human results in 2016 through its WaveNet study.

NLP in business
These technical application areas are translated into useful applications for business such as:

Filter spam: Understand whether email sender is a spammer based on word choice

Auto generate reports: Instantly generate reports to make critical data easily digestible

Serve customers: Understand customer intention through inquiries and serve the customer quickly and effectively.
